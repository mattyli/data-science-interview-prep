# what I would like to improve
    1. I would like to automate testing, i.e. write scripts that test against an online database(s)
       for example the checkPalindrome, go to some website retrieve the first 50 autogenerated palindromes
       and compare them to the results online

    2. I want to focus on making more general solutions that would work with any programming language.
       Python is a very powerful programming language that has way more features than a more basic language, 
       say C for example. So I will try to limit my use of functions that are custom to python
    
    3. In the regression analysis I performed, I was not able to display the desired curve equations, so 
       I would like to make a function that converts the numpy array of coefficients into a string of equations 
       that can be printed out to a dataframe or something like that.
    
       Apparently, polynomial curves do not fit the data best (according to the course staff) 
       so I will investigate that on my own time.
